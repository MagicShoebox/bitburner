These are my scripts from my time playing [Bitburner](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/), an [open-source](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src) cyberpunk-themed game built around writing Javascript.

I don't claim any particular innovation or expertise at Bitburner. I decided to upload these mostly for [my solutions](src/coding.js) to the ["Coding Contracts"](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/dev/src/data/codingcontracttypes.ts), which were programming puzzles.
